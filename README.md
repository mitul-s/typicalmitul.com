### Typical Mitul

Hi there! My name is Mitul, I'm a photographer and software engineer based out of Toronto, Canada. Welcome to my portfolio, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and some Radix Primitives.

My work specializes in cityscapes and architecture, but I've been heavily expanding into live music photography. I've had the pleasure to work with brands such as Shopify, Google, Delta Hotels and more.
